# CodeQuest Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my completed Code Quest Academy and Code Quest Competition solutions.  
The academy solutions are organized by difficulty level:

- **Easy:** Solutions to easier-level problems  
- **Medium:** Solutions to medium-level problems  
- **Hard:** Solutions to the hardest problems

The competition solutions are housed within their respective contests.

Each file is named after the problem title (as provided in the contest or academy) with `_solution` appended.  
For example: `calculator_solution.py`.
